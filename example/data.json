Also, Govt of India's initiative of forming a task force with a mandate to prepare a long term roadmap for the next three Olympics and a short term strategy for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics does not have a single woman in its team. She uses her experience and the amount of funds spent on the scheme and correlates with experiences on the field, which clearly show that the program is not benefiting the target group. Her observations as a former volleyball player are interesting in the wake of the fantastic show of women in the Olympics, where the women won despite the system and not because of it.","fellow":"Neha Dixit","impact_type":"Story produced","impact_type_genre":null,"ref_partner_id":33,"partner_name":"Indian Express","project_id":null,"project_name":null,"digital_asset_id":11,"asset":"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/pm-modi-should-do-more-than-just-giving-token-slogans-like-beti-khilao-4718395/","post_type":"Journalism produced","metric_id":1956,"metric_type":"social_score","genre":"impact_monitor","value":966},{"event_id":41,"event_name":"This is an announcement of the month long Gender& series in web edition of Indian Express on Facebook.
